# CSWork

## Work that I do either for CS classes or on my own

### /JAVA
This folder is used for AP Computer Science A. It contains all homework assignments, projects, labs, and other reading assignments.

### /CompSci
This folder has all submitted assignments for easily download. Java files for assignments are compressed into zip files, and general outputs from (usually) Powershell are screenshotted and put into PDFs.
